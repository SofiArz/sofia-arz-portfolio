- This portfolio is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is a static web page project.
- For the frontend I used [Tailwindcss]((https://tailwindcss.com/). 
- Animations made with pure CSS and [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion)
- The background particle animation was made following the guide ["How to Create a Beautiful Particle Animation with HTML Canvas"](https://cruip.com/how-to-create-a-beautiful-particle-animation-with-html-canvas/). You can find more interesting Nextjs tutorials from the same author here :point_right: [cruip](https://github.com/cruip/cruip-tutorials-next/tree/main)
